#Git 3 step process

The basic Git workflow after you create your repository with the command ```git init``` is:

1. You <strong>modify</strong> files in your working tree.

2. You <strong>stage</strong> the files ```git add <file_name>```, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.

3. You do a <strong>commit</strong> ```git commit -m '<commit message>'```, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git repository
