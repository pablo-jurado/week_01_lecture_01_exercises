Git is a version control system that helps to managing your project. Every time you commit a change, git saves a history log of your source code to track changes and easily gives you the chance to go back in time if you need to. 
If you want to test a new feature you have the option to branch out from your base line and experiment with new code, keeping the master branch safe and running in case your new feature could introduce unexpected bugs to your application.
Git is also a great tool to use in a team environment, making easier for a group of people to work in the same project.
